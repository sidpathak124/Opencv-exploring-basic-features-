# Opencv-exploring-basic-features-

In this repository we shall explore basic functionalities of the opencv library in python to perform varous operations on images and videos.
The functionalities and excercises here will give one a strong base to further their endeavour in Computer Vision. 
We shall learn the following things in this very order.

 1 - Read, Write and Show Images in OpenCV
 2 - Read, Write and Show Videos from Camera in OpenCV
 3 - Access your mobile camera with your computer 
 4 - Draw geometric shapes on images using Python OpenCV
 5 - Setting Camera Parameters in OpenCV Python
 6 - Show Date and Time on Videos using OpenCV Python
 7 - Handling various Mouse Events in OpenCV
 8 - Image Processing and basic Manipulation
 9- Performing Bitwise Operations on images
 10 - Applying Trackbar To manipulate values in an image 
 11 - Object Detection and Object Tracking Using HSV Color Space
 12 - Image Thresholding and Adaptive Thresholding
 13 - Using matplotlib with OpenCV
 14 - Morphological Transformations
 15 - Smoothing Images | Blurring Images 
 16 - Image Gradients and Edge Detection
 17 - Canny Edge Detection in OpenCV
 18 - Image Pyramids for advanced image processing
 19 - Image Blending using Pyramids
 20 - Find and Draw Contours of an image/video
 21 - Motion Detection and Tracking Using Opencv Contours
